    "\n",
    "In this guided project, you will explore a **dataset on apartments from Zoopla**. The goal of the project is to practice and consolidate the techniques and skills you have learned in the Python Fundamentals Series and to challenge yourself to combine different techniques in creative ways. The project will also introduce new techniques that have not been covered in the Python Fundamentals workshops.\n",

    "#### What to do if you get stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts of this project are meant to be challenging and stretch your Python skills and you will most likely have to do a web search to find help online. Being able to use effective search terms and identify useful resources is an important competency for a programmer at any level and we therefore encourage to practice this when getting stuck. If you require 1-2-1 support, please see our website for information on how to join our [daily Coding drop-ins on Teams](https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/digital-skills-lab/drop-in-sessions) to get help from a trainer.\n",
